# StatefulSets

A small update to `deployment.yaml` and renaming it to `statefulset.yaml`, after the `helm install` we get the following:

```
pod/time-server-13-0   1/1     Running   0          98s
pod/time-server-13-1   1/1     Running   0          96s
pod/time-server-13-2   1/1     Running   0          94s

NAME                              READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/time-server-13   3/3     98s

NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
service/kubernetes       ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          8d
service/time-server-13   LoadBalancer   10.103.22.204   <pending>     8080:31242/TCP   98s

```

Again, external IP is pending because we need to run `minikube tunnel` in another window.

## Volumes are not shared

First, in our `statefulset.yaml` we instruct k8s to health check our pods. Kubernetes will do this by accessing the root path of the HTTP server. This means, that our statistics will skewed. For this matter, we will instruct it to probe `/visits` path.

Now. Let's access our deployed server 10 times by updating the same tab.
```
$ kubectl exec pod/time-server-13-0 -- cat /server/visithist
2021-10-4 22:0:2.66586 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:4.685993 172.17.0.1
$ kubectl exec pod/time-server-13-1 -- cat /server/visithist
2021-10-4 22:0:3.719873 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:4.214401 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:5.619615 172.17.0.1
$ kubectl exec pod/time-server-13-2 -- cat /server/visithist
2021-10-4 22:0:5.153199 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:6.156267 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:6.623984 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:7.26583 172.17.0.1
2021-10-4 22:0:7.562735 172.17.0.1
```

We can see that the 10 requests are distributed across several instances of `/server/visits` file. Why? Because k8s will perform load balancing for the replicated pods automatically. Since each pod runs an isolated container with no real file mounted, the `/visits` will produce inconsistent results as pods cannot communicate the data. A solution would be is to deploy a database like PostgreSQL that will make sure that the same data is shared across replicas and, more importantly, that the updates to this data are synchronized.

## Parallel deployment

Since k8s 1.7 we can instruct k8s to deploy pods simultaneously. This behavior is dictated by `.spec.podManagementPolicy` that has two values: `OrderedReady` (default) and `Parallel` (what we need).

```
$ kubectl get po
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
time-server-13-parallel-0   1/1     Running   0          5s
time-server-13-parallel-1   1/1     Running   0          5s
time-server-13-parallel-2   1/1     Running   0          5s
```

Notice that this time the age is same across all pods, unlike 2s delay we saw in the first code snippet.
